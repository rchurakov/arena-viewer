# Arena Viewer
### Swift practice in playground

Project just for practicing *Swift* in the XCode *Playground*.

The idea of the ATB Arena game is taken as a basis.

Two modes are implemented:
1. Viewer: choose a Hero, choose an Artifact for him and see how his characteristics change.
2. Fight simulator: choose two Heroes, choose Artifacts and start the battle.

All results are see in console.
